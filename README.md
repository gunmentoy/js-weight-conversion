#Weight Converter

## Description
This is a simple weight converter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows you to convert pounds to grams, kilograms, and ounces.

## Features
**Weight Input**: The application provides an input field where you can enter a weight in pounds.
**Weight Conversion**: The application converts the input weight in pounds to grams, kilograms, and ounces. It displays the converted weights in separate cards.
**Dynamic Display**: The application initially hides the output cards. They become visible once you start typing in the input field.

## How It Works
The application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:
- **HTML**: The index.html file defines the structure of the application. It includes an input field for the weight in pounds and cards for displaying the converted weights.
- **CSS**: The style.css file adds styling to the HTML elements. It sets the background color, text color, and margins, and it differentiates the output cards by color.
- **JavaScript**: The main.js file adds functionality to the application. It listens for input events on the weight input field, converts the input weight to grams, kilograms, and ounces, and displays the results in the output cards.

## Usage
To use the application, open the index.html file in a web browser. Enter weight in pounds in the input field, and the converted weights will be displayed in the output cards. To run this weight converter application, you need to follow these steps:
1. Save the index.html, style.css, and main.js files in the same directory on your computer. Make sure the paths to the CSS and JS files in the index.html file are correct.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser. You can do this by right-clicking the file selecting ‘Open with’ and then choose your preferred web browser.
3. Once the index.html file is open in your web browser, you should see the weight converter application. You can now enter weight in pounds in the input field, and the converted weights will be displayed in the output cards.
